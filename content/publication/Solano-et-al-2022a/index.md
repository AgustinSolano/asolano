abstract: Sleep spindles are thought to promote memory consolidation. Recently, we have shown that visuomotor adaptation (VMA) learning increases the density of spindles and promotes the coupling between spindles and slow oscillations, locally, with the level of spindle-SO synchrony predicting overnight memory retention. Yet, growing evidence suggests that the rhythmicity in spindle occurrence may also influence the stabilization of declarative and procedural memories. Here, we examined if VMA learning promotes the temporal organization of sleep spindles into trains. We found that VMA increased the proportion of spindles and spindle-SO couplings in trains. In agreement with our previous work, this modulation was observed over the contralateral hemisphere to the trained hand, and predicted overnight memory retention. Interestingly, spindles grouped in a cluster showed greater amplitude and duration than isolated spindles. The fact that these features increased as a function of train length, provides evidence supporting a biological advantage of this temporal arrangement. Our work opens the possibility that the periodicity of NREM oscillations may be relevant in the stabilization of procedural memories.
